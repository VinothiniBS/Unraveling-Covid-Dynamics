In the tumultuous climate of the COVID-19 pandemic, nations globally faced unparalleled public health trials, with the UK standing out as one of the most significantly affected. This project seeks to deeply investigate the palpable effects of the vaccination campaign on COVID-19 metrics like infections, hospitalizations, and mortality rates in the UK. Through multivariate linear regression analyses of data spanning pre-vaccination and vaccination periods, we aim to unravel the real-world efficacy of vaccines while accounting for other external influences like human mobility and weather patterns. Our findings aspire to shape public health policies by emphasizing the crucial role of vaccinations in our fight against the pandemic.

## Overview

üöÄ **Introduction**: This project offers a comprehensive exploration of the distinctive challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular emphasis on understanding the context and outcomes within the UK. By delving into the experiences and responses of the UK in the face of this global crisis, the project seeks to unravel the intricate dynamics that have shaped the nation's journey through the pandemic. This approach provides an insightful lens through which to examine the multifaceted aspects of public health, policy interventions, and societal resilience.

üí° **Objectives**: 
-	Analyze the correlation between vaccination rates and COVID-19 outcomes in the UK.
-	Explore the impact of human mobility on the virus's transmission during pre-vaccination and vaccination periods.
-	Examine potential associations between weather patterns and COVID-19 metrics to elucidate any indirect influences.

## Data Exploration

üóÑÔ∏è **Data Source**: Our primary dataset for this investigation is sourced from **Google's expansive open data collection**, which comprehensively documents COVID-19 details for numerous countries. To tailor our study to the UK's distinctive COVID-19 landscape, we selectively extracted relevant data. Notably, this dataset is **dynamically updated**, remaining current and relevant. For our analysis, we specifically focused on data from **2020 and 2021**, resulting in approximately **761 entries**. Within this dataset, a substantial pool of around 519 variables is available. Among these, we judiciously selected about **28 variables** that were most pertinent to our research objectives. These variables encompass a spectrum of information, including confirmed cases, mortality rates, testing frequencies, hospitalization statistics, vaccination data, mobility trends, meteorological metrics, and the government's stringency index. Despite the dataset's vastness, our focused selection ensures that we are equipped with the necessary data to delve into the intricate dynamics of COVID-19, elevating the depth of our analytical exploration.

‚úÇÔ∏è **Data Segmentation**: Our analysis segregates the data timeline into two pivotal eras - the **pre-vaccination** and the **vaccination** stages with 286 and 475 entries in each dataset respectively. This bifurcation aids in a granular examination of various influencers like testing frequencies, mobility trajectories, stringency policies, and meteorological patterns across these two distinct phases. As we transition into the vaccination epoch, our scrutiny deepens to encapsulate the direct repercussions of vaccination on the metrics of confirmed cases, fatalities, and hospitalizations. 

## Methodology

In our pursuit of comprehending the significant impact of COVID-19 vaccinations within the UK, we adopted the **Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR)** technique. This powerful statistical tool excels at unveiling intricate relationships among multiple variables. Prior to diving into the specifics relevant to the UK, we meticulously examined the primary dataset for potential multicollinearity and static variables. Subsequently, we identified and retained 28 variables(as mentioned in Data Source section) that are closely aligned with our research objectives. The process involved discerning and addressing correlated independent variables and static elements, a step that fortified the resilience of our ensuing analyses. While our current approach emphasizes MLR, it's worth noting that **alternatives** such as **multivariate multiple regression and machine learning methods** could also be explored, particularly if certain variables exhibit collinearity.

The implementation of the Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) method involves the following steps:

üîç **Data Preprocessing**: Moving beyond the initial assessment of multicollinearity, we embarked on a meticulous journey of managing missing data. This involved adeptly substituting the gaps with zero values, thereby enhancing the integrity of the dataset. Furthermore, we undertook the task of formatting variables, rounding those with extensive decimals to streamline their representation. This process of uniform formatting contributes to a more coherent and comprehensible dataset, essential for our subsequent analyses.

üìä **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** This phase involved delving deep into variable distributions, discerning relationships, and identifying potential outliers to build a comprehensive understanding of our data.

A discernible trend is evident in the pre-vaccination data set: as the days progress, there is a marked increase in the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.

#### The plots shown below help to understand the trends of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the vaccination data set:

![Vaccination Trends](images/Vaccination%20Trends.jpg)

In the vaccination data set, there is a conspicuous decline in the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths as the days unfold.

üß± **Model Building:** Harnessing the power of MLR, we constructed models for both pre-vaccination and vaccination periods, aiming to capture the multifaceted influences on infection rates, hospitalizations, and fatalities.

‚úÖ **Model Evaluation:** Our models were put to the test. We gauged their efficacy using metrics like R-squared and employed cross-validation techniques for a holistic assessment.

üìë **Comparison Analysis:** A comparative study between our models allowed us to discern the tangible impacts of vaccination campaigns, providing clarity on its role amidst other influencing factors.

The analytical might of MLR, combined with our structured approach and diligent data pre-processing, offered invaluable insights into the pandemic's dynamics, showcasing the multifaceted dimensions of the pandemic in the UK.

## Pre-Vaccination Analysis

Employed __Multivariate Linear Regression__ to analyze relationships between COVID-19 outcomes and various predictors including testing rates, mobility patterns, weather metrics, and the stringency index.

üìà **Performance:** Achieved a Mean Squared Error of 0.102 on test data with an R-squared value of approximately 0.80 or higher for each response. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) obtained is 0.3207. Thus, the model seems to perform well on the pre-vaccination data, as indicated by a high R<sup>2</sup> value and relatively low error metrics (MSE and RMSE).  The high R<sup>2</sup> value indicates that the model explains a significant amount of variance in the data.

üóùÔ∏è **Key Findings:**

-	Strong positive correlation between cumulative tests and confirmed cases, deceased cases, and hospitalized patients.
-	Higher stringency index values correlated with an increase in cases.
-	Mobility reductions, especially in retail and transit stations, showed a negative correlation   with case numbers.

## Vaccination Period Analysis

Extended the multivariate regression analysis to capture the dynamics post-vaccination.

üìà **Performance:** Demonstrated an improved Mean Squared Error of 0.0702 on test data with R-squared values consistently over 0.80.The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) obtained is 0.2692. The model's performance on the vaccination data is even better than its performance on the pre-vaccination data. This is evident from the improved (lower) error metrics (both MSE and RMSE) and the consistently high R<sup>2</sup> values. The improvements suggest that the model is more accurate in predicting outcomes during the vaccination period compared to the pre-vaccination period. 

üóùÔ∏è **Key Findings:**
-	Significant negative correlation between the number of vaccinated individuals and infection cases, deceased cases, and hospitalizations.
-	Decline in transit station activity correlated with reduced cases and hospitalizations.
-	Testing rates remained pivotal in affecting case numbers, even post-vaccination.

## Conclusion and Future Directions

üèÅ **Implications**: In our extensive analysis of COVID-19 dynamics and vaccination impact, several pivotal insights surfaced:

i) **Testing** remains **paramount in understanding the pandemic's trajectory**, with a direct correlation seen across essential metrics.

ii) **Vaccination** emerged as a **crucial mitigator**, with data overwhelmingly supporting its effectiveness in curbing the virus's devastation.

iii) **Mobility**, particularly in public spaces, **significantly influences the spread**, suggesting the importance of monitoring and managing public movements.

iv) **Stringency measures** by governments, though effective to an extent, **yield optimal results when synergized with a robust vaccination drive**.

v) **Weather**, intriguingly, has its indirect yet noteworthy influence, with **warmer climates showing a promising correlation with diminished infections**.

In essence, the investigation underscores the importance of a multi-pronged approach to Covid-19 control, where testing, vaccination, controlled mobility, stringent government measures, and an understanding of weather interplays are vital in steering us towards a safer tomorrow. 

Amidst the insightful results, we encountered **intriguing contradictions**. Vaccination and the stringency index showed positive correlations with COVID-19 outcomes, while mobility factors exhibited a negative correlation. These anomalies arise from the intricate interplay of factors. High vaccination areas could have increased testing, leading to a heightened awareness of cases. Additionally, the increase in cases might be indicative of higher population density and connectivity in urban areas, where vaccination efforts are concentrated. While stringent measures might lead to temporary case surges. The negative correlation between mobility factors and COVID-19 outcomes could be attributed to reduced transmission opportunities in areas with decreased mobility.  These complexities underscore the **multifaceted nature of pandemic dynamics**.

üîÆ **Future Scope**: While our current analysis employs Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) to explore the relationships between various variables and COVID-19 outcomes, it's important to acknowledge that more sophisticated analytical approaches are available. In the realm of advanced statistical techniques, methods such as **machine learning algorithms, time series modeling, and Bayesian analysis** offer alternative avenues for comprehending complex pandemic dynamics. These methods could potentially uncover nuanced interactions and non-linear relationships within the data. Additionally, future studies could probe the impact of vaccination on emerging COVID-19 variants, assess the **role of vaccine boosters** in maintaining immunity, and investigate the **synergistic effects of combining public health measures with vaccination strategies**. Considering these alternative approaches and expanding our research scope could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted factors influencing COVID-19 outcomes.
